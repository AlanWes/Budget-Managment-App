# Budget Management Application
#### This is an ongoing project aimed at creating a web application that helps manage your budget. The goal of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use platform to track their expenses and incomes, and to help them stay on top of their financial goals.
## Current Progress
#### We are currently working on developing the core functionality of the application, which includes user authentication, data input, and data visualization. Our next steps for this project include implementing additional features such as budget goal setting, transaction categorization, and integration with third-party financial apps.
#### We plan to continue testing and improving the application's functionality in order to create a robust and user-friendly budget management tool. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
